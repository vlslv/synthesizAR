# synthesizAR
synthesizAR is a Python package for forward modeling emission from solar active regions using hydrodynamic simulations of coronal loops. Given an HMI magnetogram and the results of some time-dependent loop code (e.g. EBTEL or HYDRAD), a dynamically heated active region can be synthesized as observed by some space-based instrument, e.g. SDO/AIA.
